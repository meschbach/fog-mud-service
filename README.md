# Fog Mud Storage System

A network-based system for abstracting out storage unstructured data through a container-key-value store.  The goal is
to provide the ability for build a number of applications which are agnostic to the location of the data they work one
while providing redundancy and encryption. For example, this could store a repository of your personal pictures, which
would then be backed up transparently and securely to a provider such as Dropbox.  For viewing your images you could
build an application which transparently scales the images, having Mud orchestrate the dance with which images are
cached and where.

## Running the Service

### In Docker

```bash
docker run -d -P meschbach/fog-mud
```

### From Service
The easiest method to run the service on your current node from a checkout copy of the source is:
```bash
node cli omni
``` 

You may use the `--help` option to provide additional details and options to configure for your particular use case.

## Service Achitecture

There are three tiers to the application: the client interface service, the metadata service, and storage services.  All
clients should be communicating with the client interface.  This will interpret client requests, deal with chunking,
compression, etc.  The _metadata_ service is responsible for manging container infromation and making decisions on where
data will rest.  _Storage_ services will accept blocks from a client interface to sotre and retreive.

Ideally you would only need a single client interface and metadata service.  You would have one storage service running
on the device with the disk you wish to hold the data.
